         Body="&lt;p&gt;While answering a few of &lt;a href=&quot;https://coffee.stackexchange.com/users/8/edchum&quot;&gt;EdChum&lt;/a&gt;'s questions I discovered that what I/we in the USA call pour over coffee is referred to as drip coffee in the UK. I added the pour-over tag to both questions I encountered but figured we should decide as a community which tag to use to describe this brewing process and then properly document it because drip-coffee means something different in the US (which is apparently referred to as filter-cofee in the UK). For clarification the method in question is shown in the image below. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.stack.imgur.com/8BYnT.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"

         Body="&lt;p&gt;It looks like filter coffee has &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_filter_coffee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;another, different meaning&lt;/a&gt; too. When I read &quot;drip coffee,&quot; I think of the kind you &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drip_brew&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;get from a traditional coffeemaker&lt;/a&gt;. Go for &quot;pour-over.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;"
