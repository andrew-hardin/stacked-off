  <row Id="6" PostId="1" Score="0" Text="Recommending both would be confusing; generally you want to use one tag, and make any other names a tag synonym (you don't want to have half the questions have one name, and the other have a different one, making it hard to get a list of all questions about that particular topic)."

  <row Id="7" PostId="1" Score="0" Text="Certainly, the terms &quot;pour-over&quot;, &quot;drip&quot;, and &quot;filter&quot; (and perhaps others...) need regional disambiguation; perhaps this should be a question at [main] main site? I fear clarifying text in every question/answer will be necessary. Making uniform the vernacular of the entire world might be easier. ;-)" CreationDate="2015-02-11T16:32:01.823" UserId="6" />
  <row Id="8" PostId="1" Score="1" Text="@hoc_age Tagging terminology needs to be nailed down in the tag wiki for the site so for our purposes Yes, it does need to be agreed upon and defined.

  <row Id="9" PostId="1" Score="0" Text="@JoshuaAslanSmith - agreed about the tag terminology, and I think  you've convinced me that the best place to &quot;define&quot; our *lingua franca* is the tag wiki. My comment on [this answer](http://meta.coffee.stackexchange.com/a/24/262) summarizes my feelings about the (more-)general problem." CreationDate="2015-02-11T17:09:52.737" UserId="6" />
